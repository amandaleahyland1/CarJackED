# CarJacked – DMV Driving Test Simulator

A browser-based driving test game styled after GTA: San Andreas and synthwave aesthetics. Navigate the real Watsonville-to-Aptos DMV test route, master critical intersections, and avoid automatic failure scenarios.

## How to Play

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** — Steer, accelerate, brake
- **N** — Skip to next level
- **P** — Pause
- **Goal:** Complete all 7 levels without hitting an auto-fail condition

## The Challenge

**Level 7: 41st Ave & Brommer**
